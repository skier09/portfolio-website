I learned how to deploy a website using AWS Amplify
I learned how to create an AWS lambda function paired with
an API Gateway to create a contact form that sends emails to a personal account from my website.
(Used a REST API for this!)

obviously learned how to deploy a dev environment and use nodejs for testing the react app

Just more experience with creating UI elements and a React based website.
